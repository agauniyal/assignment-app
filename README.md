Tada!


Todo:

- [x] Add relation b/w colleges and degrees. (aka migrate to embedded docs)
> Currently I have seperate degrees and seperate colleges.

- [x] Add angular route to frontend
> Reading ..

- [ ] iterate over error during validation, instead of just printing first (easy-peasy)
> Priority low - use a loop in ejs over errors and send error[] instead of error[0]

- [ ] refactor router.js into routes.js and controller.js
> Like this - https://github.com/agauniyal/bookapi/blob/master/routes/bookRoutes.js (see first two routes and corresponding controller file)

- [ ] append get parameters to redirect to fill previously filled form elements
> priority low - send get param and read them and place into <input>'s value=""

- [ ] TESTS!!
> Like this - https://github.com/agauniyal/bookapi/blob/master/tests/bookControllerTests.js .
